# Bay-Area-Dog-Training
Repository for BADT database files

# Project Outline
Bay Area Dog Training is a small, locally owned business, grossing approximately $2 million in revenue annually and has around 100 regularly returning dogs at any given time. Services include private one-on-one lessons, group training sessions, and socialization classes for puppies. Group training sessions and courses will be offered a few times per week, mainly during evenings and weekends, to accommodate customers' busy schedules. One-on-one training can occur at any time in coordination with individual trainers. 

The website and its database backend will record important entities relevant to the operation of the dog training business, such as providing details on each customer and their dog and individual employee information. The database will also record sales and performance of classes, including the volume of participants and feedback from attendees. The database will need to store individual trainers' information, availability, schedules, and qualifications. 

Training sessions are offered individually and in bulk for a discount, including packages of 5, 10, and 15 sessions.
